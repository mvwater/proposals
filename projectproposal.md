# Knox County Water Project Proposal

## Organization Information:
### Mount Vernon Department of Water
- Engineer Brian Ball (740)-393-9528
- Utilities Director Mathias Orndorf (740) 358-6112
- Auditor Terry Scott
- Dynamic Networks rep. Joe "Snoffsnyder"

## Project Summary:
The Mount Vernon Department of Water needs a read-only archival access system to help facilitate the departments transition between system providers. They are currently using CMI's UtyX and will only be able to bring the past 3 years of customer data with them. The organization would like us to develop a database where one could search by address or unique account number and pull up all relevant information, specifically billing history and text file comment that are attached to each account. There needs to be standard availability as well as an emphasis on security. If there is extra time, they would like a report generation function that can return all relevant fields either as a `.csv`, `.psv`, `.tsv`, or a `.txt` document.

This project will follow the timeline outlined below and does not include any ongoing mantenance of the portal outside of what may be stated in the scope.

## Technology Stack & Server Architecture
We *recommend* the following technology stack for platform development:

| Technology                       |                                                                                              |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Server-Side Programming Language | C++14                                                                                        |
| Client-Side Programming Language | HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, Bootstrap 4.3                                                           |
| Database                         | MySQL 5.6                                                                                    |
| Web Server                       | Apache 2.x.x OR Nginx 1.x.x                                                                  |
| Local Hosting                    | Oracle VirtualBox 6 VM running Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS using Windows Server 2019 as the host |
| Cloud Storage                    | None recommended                                                                             |
| Content Delivery Network (CDN)   | None recommended                                                                             |
| Session & Cache Storage          | None recommended                                                                             |
| Version Control System           | Git                                                                                          |

For security reasons, local hosting is recommended for hosting the platform, and the minimum server requirements are as mentioned below:

- LAMP Stack - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)
- Operating System - Linux x86, x86-64
- PHP version 7.0 or greater - http://php.net
- MySQL version 5.6 or greater - https://www.mysql.com/
- Apache 2.x.x (mod_rewrite module enabled, https://httpd.apache.org/) OR Nginx 1.x.x (https//www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/)
- Required PHP extensions -
  + OpenSSL
  + XML
  + Ctype
  + JSON

For better performance, reliability, security, and scalability, we *suggest* the following:
- Securing the website by SSL certificate

The **recommended** high-level server architecture for the platform is as illustrated in the [following diagram](https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/view/078e9382-fdee-4b86-94dc-ece34b0e72c3 "View LucidChart Diagram").

## Features Overview
- There will be two types of users namely:
  + Admin - Who can access and manage all aspects of the platform including all registered entries, and can edit entries
  + User - Who can view any information on the platform
- The user interface for the front-end (User area) of the platform will be responsive, but not necessarily mobile friendly, as the end product is intended for desktop use. It shall support the following resolutions:
  + 320px for common smartphones
  + 480px and below for common smartphones at the landscape orientaiton
  + 768px and 960px for tablets in their common orientations
  + 960px and upwards for desktop monitors
- The following pages will be designed:
  + Home page
  + View entries
  + Search entries

## Version Control
GitHub will be used as the online version control repository hosting service for tracking all development and coding changes. We usually follow the GitFlow workflow, which as a Master branch, hotfixes, release, develop, and feature branches.

## Deliverables
Deliverables will include the following:
- Project plan.
- UI design mockups.
- Deployment on the requested domain.
- A backup copy of the files and database associated with the platform.
- Content/data addition and migration.

## Exclusions
The following are excluded from the project scope:
- Logo design
- Mobile app (iOS and Android) for Admin uses and related RESTful AP/Web services

## Project Development Methodology
The project execution methodology which will be followed for this project design and development is the rapid development (cyclical) model. We find that the rapid develoment model is a great way to successfully manage projects that are relatively small in scope, with all functional and nonfunctional requirements defined in sufficient detail before any code is written.
